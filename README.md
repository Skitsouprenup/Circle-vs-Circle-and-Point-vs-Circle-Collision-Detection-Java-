# Circle-vs-Circle-and-Point-vs-Circle-Collision-Detection-Java-
Collision algorithms for circle-to-circle collision and circle-to-point collision

The content of this project is explained in this tutorial of mine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnQp1aKVExc

This project requires viewers to have an understanding of Java basic GUI concepts and knowledgeable about trigonometry. This project mostly focuses on implementing collision algorithms.

This project demonstrates circle-to-circle collision by implementing two methods that detect if two circles are colliding. First method is using the simplified(slow) equation of pythagorean theorem equation and the second one is using the original(fast) equation of pythagorean theorem. This project also contains algorithms for point-to-circle collision.
